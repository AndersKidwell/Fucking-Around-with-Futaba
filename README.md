**What it is:**
<br>
A stupid program I made testing out the new game engine. Just seeing if I could whip something up and compile it.
<br>
<br>
**To Run:** Just download the .zip from the [Releases](https://github.com/AndersKidwell/Fucking-Around-with-Futaba/releases). Extract the zip file and run the game. (This will only run on Windows x64)
<br>
<br>
## **$${\color{red}WARNING:}$$** 
This program may flag Windows Defender. I am still figuring out how to sign my projects to be detected as safe on Windows. :P
